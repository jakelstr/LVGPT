This project originated as an idea to have LLMs generate LabVIEW VIs by way of transpiling Go code. At the time, LLMs could only really generate code from existing languages. As LLMs have become more powerful, the repository now relies solely on the Python graph builder in `python/readAST.py` and the accompanying node classes to synthesize LabVIEW diagrams. The previous Go AST tooling has been removed to simplify the pipeline.
